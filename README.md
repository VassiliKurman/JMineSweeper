# JMinesweeper
JMinesweeper is a popular arcade Minesweeper game that written in Java and uses Java swing components to display graphical user interface.

How to Play Minesweeper:
  - The object of the game is to uncover all squares that don't contain mines.
  - Left click on a square to uncover it.
  - If you uncover a mine, you lose, and the square you clicked will reveal a mine.
  - If an uncovered square displays a number, that number represents the number of neighboring mines adjacent to that square (1 - 8). If there are no mines adjacent, the square will be blank. Use these numbers to determine where you think a minemight be located.
  - You can mark a square as a mine by right clicking on it. A number at the bottom of the frame keeps track of how many mines you have left to find.
